    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>My name is Christopher Barbieri. I am 24 years old.  I go to Beacon College and currently taking Introduction to Robotics with Ms Rameirez. In the Spring of 2024 Semster, we 
        were working on programming the Tacobot to move, detect objects and utlize sound. The detection of objects is based on both color and distance.  </p>
