    <h3>Summary of Course Projects</h3>

    <p>The main point of doing these challenges were to see how robots interact with normal daily life or activity.  This relative to human activity cause have to watch where
        they are going.  In the Tacobot making appropriate turns to dodge stuff has similar features of what a normal human being would do.

    <h2>Unit 4: Sequential Movements</h2>

    <p>Here is my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4BbSmiVIszY>Sequential Movements</a> challenge.  The purpose of this challenge was to make the movement certain
    distances and stop at the three of the white lines shown in this video and at the finish.  Each of the times the TacoBot stops it had to either make a beep noise or 
to design a certain word or thing at the top of the Hub. The skills I needed to learn measurement in distance. Definitely using more of a ruler than I am used to. My role
was to use the Spike Prime Program put the specific code into the program.  When I programmed I usually made a hypothesis on what the measurment maybe.  If I was wrong
I would pull out the ruler to get the exact distance. I measured out each distance the robot was going at and speciifically looked at where the robot was stopping. I made 
guesses to see just by looking at where the robot was to see if I needed to increase or decrease distance.  I could've made robot go a little bit furter to end. I thought
my robot did well. My difficultly was definitely distance and appropriately mesasuring that out to get correct length.</p>


<h2>Unit 7: Investigating the Collapsed Building</h2>

<p>Here is my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ntBzVvJBcrA>Investigating the Collapsed Building</a> challenge.  The purpose of this challenge was for the Tacobot to
explore a dangerous site.  The robot needed to go through the building and walls without hitting them to stop towards the right end of building using it's distance sensor.
For this challenge I needed to learn patience and being calm. Also needed to learn more distance and measurements. I had to use the Spike Program for the robot to make the
appropriate turns and use appropriate sensors. I realize toward the end of this challenge to reduce my distance so the robot can properly turn without hitting walls or going
off the challenge.  I first looked at where the robot was at and broke down each of the parts in numerical order.  I could've added other piece of code to make distance sensor
more reactive and stop closer toward the finish. I thought the progam was very well responive to this challenge.  The difficulties I experienced not having proper positioning
with my robot and having too much distance. </p>


<h2>Unit 10: Search for the Ice</h2>

<p>Here is my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MP5HbqjJrek>Search for the Ice</a> challenge. The purpose of this challenge specifically was for Tacobot to go around
stopping at four of the red squares to make a beep noise on each one.  This had to repeat two times. The robot had to go around not bumping into crater in the middle.
I needed to learn calm and patience not to rush. I had to use the Spike Prime Program to put in Repeat Until block.  I had to reduce distance so the robot would stop at
the appropriate time.  I would look to see where the Robot was at and made a hypothesis of what my next move was. If something didn't go right I would stop the program
and analyze the robot with positioning. I could've not rushed this challenge too much and measure out the distance(s) more to make the robot stop more precisely at the red 
squares. By being persistent on finding out the next thing that needs to be done or adjusted. My top difficulties would be not having positioning or distance with most
of these challenges.</p>
