    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>I learned that you just gotta be patient with what you are doing or you are working on.  If you just take your time in any situation or task you gota accomplish you
        will get it done.  Come up with strategies, say to yourself "what can I do better with this?"  or "I notice this was outcome maybe if I look at the other pieces of
        the picture I can come up with something else." If the situation or task is really bother you walk away from it but productivity is still key.  Think about what coud
        you do next or better idea to make the problem eaiser.
